# CardIndex

**Experimental and Incomplete and Abandoned**

A GUI application that provides the facilities of a physical card index with
the added advantages of software.

Any number of cards may be created and any number of boxes.

Unlike physical cards, each CardIndex card may be added to as many different
boxes as you like (e.g., if each box represents some category, some cards
may belong to more than one category and so may be put in multiple boxes).

Also unlike physical cards, every word in every card is indexed to support
full text search. The search also supports word stems and wildcards.
